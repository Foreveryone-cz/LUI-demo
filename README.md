# LUI - Less UI
LUI or "Less UI" is front-end framework made to make your coding easier. If you dont need all the stuff around you can just use our grid and mixins. Other UI stuff like forms/tables will be as "extra" package in the future

####Website on way. All documentation will be there instead of this git repo, this repo will contain just stuff you need

This repo cointains basic UI elements that most websites need. 
From stuff like error messages all the way to responsive forms and tables. If you like your own UI stuff, you can just use mixin collection to make your life easier :)

New website with better documentation and more languages on way

**Awesome grid system**
- able to set both vertical and horizontal position of columns (!!!)
- more resolutions, but if you dont need responsive, you can simply use static grid (!)
- extra columns size for print (!!)
- need 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 columns in grid? no problem!
- **flexbox FTW**
 
**UI stuff:**
- Responsive forms
- Responsive table
- Mobile friendly pagebar
- FontAwesome!
- Some buttons - also mobile friendly if you need

**Mixins for:**
- animation
- border-radius
- box-sizing
- clearing (using :before / :after)
- filters (colors, contrast, ..)
- flexbox
- grandient

**on way:**
